This is how I do CI for my web site

The process consists of 3 tasks which can be executed independently
1) Release 
	- compile 
	- execute tests
2) Backup  
	- download content from FTP and 
	- zip-it to Backup-ProjectName 23-3-2011 22-55-32.7z
3) Deploy 
	- upload the Artifacts content to FTP

How to reuse ?
	- rename Environment.ps1.template into Environment.ps1
	- add Environment.ps1 into your Git/Svn/Tfs ingore KEEP IT JUST FOR YOU, this will ensure credentials privacy and development configuration autonomy

Your feedback will be greatly appreciated
